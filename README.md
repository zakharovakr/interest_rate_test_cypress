# Interest rate input field automated test cases - Cypress

## Project Description

This project is part of an interview assignment designed to demonstrate test automation skills.

The assignment is to:
- Create a [test plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uuKeqUgh16yLjZ94JiYwaf3m596AqGC-yljasN1PQw8/edit?usp=sharing) for the Interest Rate input field on the [Zillow Mortgage Calculator](https://www.zillow.com/mortgage-calculator/) page;
- Automate two of the test cases using Cypress. 

## How to run this project

### Prerequisites to run the tests: 
System requirements - refer to the [official Cypress Documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress#System-requirements) (make sure you have Node.js installed)

### Setup 

1. Fork the repo to your `Github`
2. Clone the repo to your local machine and navigate to your folder

After forking this project in `Github`, run these commands:

```bash
## clone this repo locally
git clone <your project name>

## navigate to your folder
cd /your/project/path
```

3. Install Cypress - follow the [official documentation instructions ](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress#Installing)

Example command for installing Cypress with `npm` (you can use other ways)

```bash
## install Cypress
npm install cypress --save-dev
```

4. Open Cypress - follow the [official documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress#Installing)

Example command for opening Cypress with `npm` (you can use other ways)
   
```bash
## open Cypress from your project root using
npx cypress open
```
5. In Cypress IDE choose "E2E Testing"
6. Choose your browser -> Click on "Start E2E Testing"
7. Click on `interest_rate_tests.cy.js` -> the tests will run (and hopefully pass)

P.S. Alternatively, you can run the tests in the terminal using `npx cypress run` instead of steps 4-7.

## Additional Notes

### Considerations for the future: 
- choosing better and more reliable CSS selectors;
- using environment variables;
- implementing custom commands;
- creating a comprehensive test structure with tests and test suites that cover all the most important parts of the application;
- making sure the tests are independent and can be run together and separately;
- adding test data sets; 
- setting up Continuous Integration (CI).
